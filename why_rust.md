# 🧠 Memory Safety and Rust in Graphics Engine Development

Graphics engines push hardware to its limits — rendering millions of vertices per second, juggling GPU resources, textures, meshes, and multithreaded tasks.  
In this environment, **memory safety** is not just a nicety — it’s a foundation for stability, performance, and correctness.

Rust provides a unique model that guarantees **memory safety at compile time** without sacrificing **speed or control**.

## ⚙️ What Is Memory Safety?

**Memory safety** means that a program will never:

- Access invalid or freed memory.
- Read or write out of array bounds.
- Have data races between threads.
- Leak memory unintentionally.

In unsafe languages like C and C++, such errors can:

- Cause unpredictable crashes.
- Corrupt rendering data or GPU buffers.
- Introduce subtle visual glitches.
- Lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs.

Rust’s **ownership model** prevents these problems _before your program even runs._

## 🦀 Rust’s Ownership System

Rust enforces three core rules about memory access:

1. **Each value has a single owner.**

   - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically freed.
   - No manual `free()` or `delete`.

2. **You can borrow data immutably (`&T`) or mutably (`&mut T`), but not both at the same time.**

   - Prevents simultaneous read/write errors.
   - Enforced at compile time.

3. **References must always be valid.**
   - The compiler checks lifetimes to ensure you never use freed memory.

These rules eliminate entire classes of bugs like:

```cpp
// C++ example: use-after-free
Mesh* mesh = new Mesh();
delete mesh;
mesh->render(); // ❌ undefined behavior
```
```
// Rust: compile-time error
let mesh = Mesh::new();
drop(mesh);
mesh.render(); // ❌ cannot use after move (caught at compile time)
